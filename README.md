# PPRANK
"PPRank:Economically selecting intial users for influence maximization in social networks" based on IEEE paper.

For my final year project, I implemented “PPRank: Influence Maximization in Social Networks”, a predominantly data analytics and web technology based project, which entailed different elements of Online Social Network and E-commerce. I made use of the optimized Cost-effective lazy forward (CELF) algorithm for the calculations. I researched extensively and learnt the MVC framework of web application development, using the HTML 5 and bootstrap to generate my frontend, Apache tomcat to serve as servers and Java Server Pages and MySQL to form the back end. For Database I implemented the  DAO (Data Access Object) layer to abstract the intricate details of database CRUD operations (Create, read, update and delete). Please visit the screenshot folder to look at the implemented snapshots of the project. Or to run the program please follow the instruction given below.
